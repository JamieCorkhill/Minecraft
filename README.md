# Minecraft

A full clone and re-implementation of Minecraft with available APIs to permit third-party modding. This implementation is built in C# and follows best practice architectural, design, and unit/integration testing patterns, including (but not limited to), SOLID, CQS, Separation of Concerns, DRY, and Inversion of Control via Dependency Injection.

Although using Unity sorts of take the "easy way out", I would like to redo this project in the future in pure C++ and OpenGL.

## Note on Video Games

Personally, I'm not a fan of video games at all. I haven't played one in 4 years and I believe they are massive time wasters and harmful to productivity. With that said, I feel that the learning opportunities resultant of re-implementing a popular video game on the scale of Minecraft - especially with proper architectural, design, and testing patterns - are immense, thus I'm taking the time to do this.
