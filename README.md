# Minecraft

A full clone and re-implementation of Minecraft with available APIs to permit third-party modding. Although most modding is possible, the provided APIs place emphasis on the notion of real-time, real-world data visualation and control within the game. Examples include ingesting third-party API data and displaying it within a HUD or some other in-game element, monitoring player biometrics, etc. Further posibilities include building in-game HTTP Clients, being able to control external electronic systems from Redstone, or evening monitoring an Apache Kafka Cluster from within the game if you're that way inclined (I am, because, why not?).

This implementation is built in C# and follows best practice architectural, design, and unit/integration testing patterns, including (but not limited to), SOLID, CQS, Separation of Concerns, DRY, and Inversion of Control via Dependency Injection.

Although using Unity sort of takes the "easy way out", I would like to redo this project in the future in pure C++ and OpenGL.

## About & Note on Video Games

Personally, I'm not a fan of video games at all. I haven't played one in 4 years and I believe they are massive time wasters and harmful to productivity. With that said, I feel that the learning opportunities resultant of re-implementing a popular video game on the scale of Minecraft - especially with proper architectural, design, and testing patterns - are immense, thus I'm taking the time to do this. This will be the first "proper" game I've ever built.

Despite having a certain amount of "disdain" for video games, I do love electronic control systems and real-time data visualzation, and said love offsets my aforementioned disdain. Really, I just find the notion of being able to control real-world systems and consume real-world data within a game like Minecraft to be a rather interesting endeavor.
